# Chatter

Chatter is a move that already exists in canon Pok√©mon games, but is implemented completely differently in this game,
as it is central to the game's mechanics. In this game, Chatter is a move that calls another move, like Metronome or
Sleep Talk.

The move's behavior with the controller active (i.e., the behavior on stream) depends on the chat's activity and is
controlled by emotes. This is the game's central mechanic and generally well understood by all players. However, this
is not possible when the game is played by a standalone player, without a controller and a chat to determine which
move to call. Therefore, an alternate procedure is needed in that case.

Instead, Chatter will call a move from the player's party. The move will always be a damaging move (unless none are
available) and it will never be a self-destructing move or one of a short list of moves that Chatter is not allowed to
call (Counter, Covet, Mirror Coat, Psywave and Thief). The game will always attempt to select the move that will deal
the most damage to the opponent, accounting for type matchups and the power of each move. (This might, however, result
in the game selecting a move with drawbacks, such as Hyper Beam or Flare Blitz.)
